   - Bite → `bite-sound.mp3`
3. Put BOTH files in the same folder as your `index.html` file:
   ```
   food-clicker/
   ├── index.html
   ├── lofi-music.mp3  ← Your music file here
   └── bite-sound.mp3  ← Your bite sound here
   ```
4. Refresh your browser and the real audio should play!

## Tips

- Make sure the file names are EXACT (including the `.mp3` extension)
- If sounds don't play, check the browser console (F12) for error messages
- You can swap out the music anytime by replacing `lofi-music.mp3` with a different file

Enjoy your game with REAL sounds! 🎵🔊
